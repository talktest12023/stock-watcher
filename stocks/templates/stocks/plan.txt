💡 Here's how you can enhance your project:
✅ 1. Line Charts for Price / Volume (Already Started)

Use Chart.js or Plotly in the frontend to show:

    Price trends over time (Close price)

    Volume trends (detect unusual spikes)

✅ 2. Peer Comparison

Create a comparison dashboard:

    User selects 2–5 stocks

    Show side-by-side graphs / tables of:

        PE Ratio, ROCE, ROE, Debt-to-Equity, etc.

        1Y Return, 5Y Return (you can get this from yfinance or nsetools)

✅ 3. Profit & Loss and Cash Flow Statements

Use:

    yfinance.Ticker().financials for profit/loss

    ticker.cashflow for cash flow

    Display these as tables or bar charts (income, expenses, etc.)

✅ 4. Z-Score for Volume/Price Spike Detection

Detect anomalies in:

    Volume (unusual activity)

    Price (gap-ups, gap-downs)

✅ 5. Stock Alerts / Email Notifications

Let users set a price target or spike alert and receive email alerts.
